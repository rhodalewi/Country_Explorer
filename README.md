# üåç Country Explorer

A simple React website that displays a list of countries fetched from the REST Countries API. Users can:
  
- View all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search countries by name
- Filter countries by region
- View detailed information about each country
- Click back to return to the homepage
- Toggle dark/light mode
